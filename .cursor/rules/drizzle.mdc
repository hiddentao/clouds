# Drizzle ORM Rules

## Migrations

- Never create migrations manually. Always use Drizzle Kit to generate them.
- Use `bun drizzle-kit generate` to create migrations based on schema changes.
- Use `bun drizzle-kit push` to apply migrations to the database.
- Use `bun drizzle-kit drop` to drop tables (with caution).

## Schema Management

- Use Drizzle's type inference system for type safety.
- Use explicit column types and constraints.
- Always add appropriate indexes for query optimization.

## Migration Naming Conventions

- Migration names should be descriptive of the changes being made.
- Use prefixes for different types of migrations:
  - `add_` for adding new tables or columns
  - `remove_` for removing tables or columns
  - `alter_` for modifying existing tables or columns
  - `rename_` for renaming tables or columns

## Version Control

- Never modify generated migration files after they've been created.
- If a migration needs to be changed, create a new one instead.
