- Use bun for package management at all times. Use bunx to NPM executables.
- Use the [concurrently](mdc:https:/www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) package for run scripts in parallel
- Use bunx instead of npx at all times.
- Use `bun run` instead of `npm run` at all times.
- For monorepos, where each package has its own build or dev script command, ensure there is a root package.json script command that can run these commands for all packages together. Use concurrently for long-running dev commands that don't exit and simple concatenation for commands that do exit, like builds.
