When building with PIXI.js the following guidelines apply:

* Check pixi version in package.json to know which API version to build with. Look up the docs for this version to know which methods to use. 
* NEVER use deprecated drawing methods. Always looks up the API docs for the installed PIXI.js version to know how to do things properly.
* Always use the PIXI shared ticker instead of requestAnimationFrame.
